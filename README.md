Rugra: Ultra minimal graphics library for Rust.
===============================================

Rugra is a very small and simple 2D graphics
library for Rust. It's based on CSFML (RSFML).

Rugra aims to be easy to use and learn. It's
intented for new Rustaceans and for people who
just want to get started with their project
fast.

Rugra is currently very limited, so you're
welcome to sent a pull request for adding new
features.

To get rugra working, you have to install
CSFML, either by using you package manager
or downloading and bulding it manually.
